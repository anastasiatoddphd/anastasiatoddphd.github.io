Hi my name is Dr. Anastasia Todd! I am an Assistant Professor in Gender and Women's Studies at the University of Kentucky. I think and write about disability, girlhood, and the media. My first book is called *Cripping Girlhood* (Michigan, 2024. Read an open access copy [here](https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.12769443).

I created this website using the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com). I used these two tutorials to help me: [1](https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/06/academic-website/), [2](https://medium.com/@carlbettosi/create-a-personal-academic-website-easily-with-github-pages-and-jekyll-minimal-coding-f1115eeb5ab7).
