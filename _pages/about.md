Hi! I am an Assistant Professor in Gender and Women's Studies at the University of Kentucky. I think and write about disability, girlhood, and the media. My first book is called *Cripping Girlhood* (Michigan, 2024). Read an open access copy [here](https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.12769443).

At the University of Kentucky, I teach courses like Gender & Disability, Feminist Affect Theory, Feminist Theory, and Girlhood Studies. 

Read some other stuff I've written about: [disabled girlhood and service dogs on TikTok](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/14/2/30); [military vets, service dogs, and ablenationalism](https://ojs.library.osu.edu/index.php/dsq/article/view/8297); [disabled girlhood on YouTube](https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/girlhood-studies/11/3/ghs110305.xml). 

Email me if you want to chat more about crip-fluencers, cats, or reality television: **anastasia.todd@uky.edu**.

I created this website using the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and am hosting it on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com). I used these two tutorials to help me: [1](https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/06/academic-website/), [2](https://medium.com/@carlbettosi/create-a-personal-academic-website-easily-with-github-pages-and-jekyll-minimal-coding-f1115eeb5ab7).
